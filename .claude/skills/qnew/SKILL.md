Open the session by internalizing this project's rules and loading mandatory session skills. Read, then commit — write no code yet.

## Steps

1. **Locate the instruction file.** Read whichever exists at the project root:
   `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) or `AGENTS.md` (Antigravity). Also read any `.claude/rules/*.md`
   / `.agents/rules/*.md` and files under `guides/` or `docs/` the instruction file points to.
2. **If none exists**, say so and stop — recommend running `/init` (or `/setup-agents`) to create
   one. Do not invent practices or start coding.
3. **Load mandatory skills.** Explicitly load and activate `ponytail` (minimalist, simplest working solution, YAGNI, standard library first), `caveman` (compressed, terse, token-efficient communication mode), and `i-have-adhd` (action-first, numbered steps, visible progress, no fluff) for this session.
4. **Parse the practices.** Pull out the concrete standards: naming, error handling, testing
   expectations, the required pre-commit/quality gate, commit conventions, and any explicit
   MUST/MUST NOT rules.
5. **Commit and confirm.** State that these govern every change this session, confirming `ponytail`, `caveman`, and `i-have-adhd` are active, then echo the key practices back in a short list (proof of comprehension, not a full reprint).

## Output

Terse. `✓ Read <file> (+N rules)` + `✓ Loaded skills: ponytail, caveman, i-have-adhd`, then a bulleted list of the practices that will bind the session. End: `Ready.` Nothing more.

If the instruction file is empty or has no actionable rules, say exactly that and ask the user to
fill it in before continuing.
